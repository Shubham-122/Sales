✅ Step-by-Step: The EASIEST and FASTEST Way to Export the Power BI Model View
Since SSMS + DMV queries are being super annoying with syntax/connection issues, let's switch to DAX Studio — it's built specifically for this purpose and works like a charm.

You’ve already opened DAX Studio before, so just follow this:

🛠️ How to Export Power BI Model Relationships (Correct Way):
🔁 1. Open DAX Studio
Launch your Power BI report.

Open DAX Studio.

At the top, in the "Connect" screen, choose:

Data Source: Power BI / PBI/SSDT Model

Hit Connect

2. ✅ Correct Approach in DAX Studio (DMV pane):
You must use DMV-compatible syntax, which is just:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM $SYSTEM.TMSCHEMA_RELATIONSHIPS
That’s it — no EVALUATE, no SELECTCOLUMNS.

🧠 Want to Join and Get Clean Relationship Details?
If you want to get friendly table/column names like:

FromTableName

FromColumnName

ToTableName

ToColumnName

You need to export the following DMV results as separate CSVs:

SELECT * FROM $SYSTEM.TMSCHEMA_RELATIONSHIPS

SELECT * FROM $SYSTEM.TMSCHEMA_TABLES

SELECT * FROM $SYSTEM.TMSCHEMA_COLUMNS









💾 3. Export the Results
After it runs:

Go to the Results grid below.

Click on “File” → “Save Results” → Save it as relationships.csv.
